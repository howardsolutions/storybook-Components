The Figma designs that inspire the components in this repository can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Qhb4PJucNK8bgvf4N65Jrm/Anthology?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Dr1OUnsNFnelFSUN-1).

Other Resources:

1. Figma Plugin to convert design colors to CSS variables or in Tailwind Theme format: `variable2css`

2. FontSource for font in our design system.

3. Class Variance Authority is a framework agnostic tool for creating variants of a component with different classes. It’s super simple and you probably could write it yourself if you had to—but, you don’t have to because it already exists.
